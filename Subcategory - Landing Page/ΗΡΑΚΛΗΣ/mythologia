Κατά μία ερμηνεία οι διάφορες στάσεις, όπως η κατενώπιον επίθεση (με γροθιές στο πρόσωπο), η καταδίωξη (ο ένας πίσω από τον άλλον), η υπερνίκηση (ο ένας γονατιστός έναντι του άλλου) αποτελούν τα συνεχόμενα «επεισόδια» του αγώνα ενός και μόνο ζεύγους αθλητών σε κάθε ζώνη.
Οι αθλητές απεικονίζονται με λεπτότατη μέση, ψηλά πόδια και τονισμένη μυολογία στα πόδια και στον κορμό. Πρόκειται για μια συγκεντρωτική απεικόνιση των κύριων αθλητικών δραστηριοτήτων που λάμβαναν χώρα στη μινωική Κρήτη, κατά τους χρόνους της μέγιστης ακμής.

                        <p>Conical libation vase with relief scenes in four zones, depicting pairs of boxers wearing gloves and special footwear, engaging in two distinct types of boxing, judging from the different helmets (with or without plumes and cheek pieces), pairs of wrestlers, and bull-leapers (we see the ill-fated leap of one athlete). In one interpretation, the different poses, such as the frontal attack (with punches to the face), the pursuit (one behind the other) and the victory (one kneeling in front of the other) are successive “episodes” of the match of a single pair of athletes in each zone. 
The athletes are portrayed with narrow waists, long legs and strongly muscled legs and torso. This is a comprehensive depiction of the main athletic activities that took place in Minoan Crete at its greatest height.
                        <!--</p>
                        <p> Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the nativity of any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into the sea? 
                        </p>
                        <p>But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be to stand before a jury ere it be born to the world, and undergo yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues, ere it can pass the ferry backward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious iniquity, provoked and troubled at the first entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and new hells wherein they might include our books also within the number of their damned. And this was the rare morsel so officiously snatched up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our inquisiturient bishops, and the attendant minorites their chaplains. That ye like not now these most certain authors of this licensing order, and that all sinister intention was far distant from your thoughts, when ye were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of your actions, and how ye honour truth, will clear ye readily.

            <p>This may have much reason to discourage the ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their exhortations, and the benefiting of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit to be turned loose to three sheets of paper without a licenser; that all the sermons, all the lectures preached, printed, vented in such numbers, and such volumes, as have now well nigh made all other books unsaleable, should not be armour enough against one single Enchiridion, without the castle of St. Angelo of an Imprimatur.</p> </div> </article> <article class="content__article content__article--invert" id="content-6"> <h2 class="heading"> <span data-splitting="">Quantum</span> <span data-splitting="">leap</span> </h2> <div class="content__text"> <p>Sometimes five Imprimaturs are seen together dialogue-wise in the piazza of one title-page, complimenting and ducking each to other with their shaven reverences, whether the author, who stands by in perplexity at the foot of his epistle, shall to the press or to the sponge.
